# google-image-world
Proof of concept

Use Google Maps to display a large world of images or photos.

Needs apache with mod_rewrite and php

### index.html
Current showcase


### tiles/render.php
This php file renders the tiles which are requested by the google maps api. Currently only the coordinates and a
cross are rendered. Instead of this you could insert / load images and display them.
